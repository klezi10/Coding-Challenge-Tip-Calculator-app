## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first responsive workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned to add an event listener to multiple buttons. I also learned how to check for validity of number input, for example as in this case, to only allow whole, positive numbers in the number of people input. I also learned how to reset the app by refreshing the page instead of resetting everything manually.

### Continued development

Fix a bug where you can only click one tip button at a time.

For now, I set manual reset on three inputs as a page refresh didn't work in Firefox like it worked in Chrome. I'd like to learn how to reset the page by refreshing it in Firefox.
